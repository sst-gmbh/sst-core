// Dataset is the representation of an RDF Dataset and all it's revisions within an SST Repository.
// Like an RDF Dataset an SST Dataset consists of a default NamedGraph and all the other NamedGraphs that are either directly or indirectly imported.
// Note: For SST also the default graph is a NamedGraph.
// Note: In OWL2, direct imported NamedGraphs are provided by owl:imports.
// An example of an indirect import is when NamedGraph A imports NamedGraph B which then imports NamedGraph C.
// In this case NamedGraph A directly imports NamedGraph B and indirectly imports NamedGraph C.
// All imports of NamedGraph within a Dataset must form zero, one or several directed acyclic graphs.
// SST ensures this by checking for cyclic imports during [NamedGraph.AddImport] for the current Stage.
// Inside the SST API imports are handled by the special methods [NamedGraph.DirectImports], [NamedGraph.AddImport], and [NamedGraph.RemoveImport].
//
// The set of DatasetRevisions of a Dataset form a directed acyclic graph following their parents with either 0 (if new), one (if it is a revision of previous one) or 2 (if merging).
// This parent information is imbedded in commit structure.
//
// Unique BranchNames within a Dataset can be stored for particular DatasetRevisions.
// BranchNames are set by SetBranch and removed by RemoveBranch.
// BranchNames by default are not synchronized between different Datasets.
//
// An SST Dataset can be retrieve from an SST Repository by methods such as [Repository.CreateDataset] or [Repository.OpenDataset].
// The latest revision of a Dataset of any branch is loaded into a new Stage by method [Dataset.StageForBranch].
// A specific revision of a Dataset is loaded into a new Stage by method [Dataset.StageAtCommit].
// All these methods ensure that the default NamedGraphs and other direct and indirect imported NamedGraphs are loaded in the revisions that corresponds to the specified branch or commit.
