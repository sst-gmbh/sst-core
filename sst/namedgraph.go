// its execution. If the callback returns an error, the iteration stops and the
// error is propagated back to the caller.

// method. For each IRI node, it applies the callback and then recursively processes
// its related nodes (subject, predicate, and object) if they are blank nodes
// and belong to the same base IRI as the namedGraph.

// - callback: A function that takes an *ibNode as input and returns an error.

// Returns:
//   - error: An error if the callback function returns an error during iteration,
//     otherwise nil.
